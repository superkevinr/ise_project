Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "U0/physical_group__1Hz/_1Hz_BUFG" (output signal=CP_1Hz) has a mix of
   clock and non-clock loads. The non-clock loads are:
   Pin I1 of secLED1

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           114 out of   1,920    5%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               156 out of   1,920    8%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            131 out of     960   13%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     131 out of     131 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     131   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         227 out of   1,920   11%
    Number used as logic:               156
    Number used as a route-thru:         71

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 22 out of      83   26%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.03

Peak Memory Usage:  4435 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  2 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   1 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
