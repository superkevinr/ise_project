Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           114 out of   1,920    5%

    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     131 out of     131 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     131   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.

    Number used as logic:               156
    Number used as a route-thru:         71

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.03

Peak Memory Usage:  4435 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  2 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   1 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "U0/physical_group__1Hz/_1Hz_BUFG" (output signal=CP_1Hz) has a mix of
   clock and non-clock loads. The non-clock loads are:
   Pin I1 of secLED1

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network Hour<6> has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 1 more times for the following
   (max. 5 shown):
   Hour<7>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   5 block(s) optimized away
   2 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic reported below is either:
   1. part of a cycle
   2. part of disabled logic
   3. a side-effect of other trimmed logic

The signal "Hour<6>" is unused and has been removed.
The signal "Hour<7>" is unused and has been removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		D0/XST_GND
VCC 		D0/XST_VCC
GND 		R1/XST_GND
GND 		U0/XST_GND
VCC 		U0/XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
