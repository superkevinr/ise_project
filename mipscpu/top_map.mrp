Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   1
Number of warnings :   4

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:198 - NCD was not produced.  All logic was removed from the design. 
   This is usually due to having no input or output PAD connections in the
   design and no nets or symbols marked as 'SAVE'.  You can either add PADs or
   'SAVE' attributes to the design, or run 'map -u' to disable logic trimming in
   the mapper.  For more information on trimming issues search the Xilinx
   Answers database for "ERROR:Pack:198" and read the Master Answer Record for
   MAP Trimming Issues.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:701 - PAD symbol "clkin" has an undefined IOSTANDARD.
WARNING:LIT:702 - PAD symbol "clkin" is not constrained (LOC) to a specific
   location.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal reset connected to top level port reset has been
   removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal clkin connected to top level port clkin has been
   removed.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network
   dram/U0/xst_options.dist_mem_inst/gen_sp_ram.spram_inst/qspo_int<31> has no
   load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 31 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):

   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
3336 block(s) removed
3336 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
